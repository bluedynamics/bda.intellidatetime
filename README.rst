bda.intellidatetime
===================

Overview
--------

``bda.intellidatetime`` provides a converter for date and time input to python
``datetime.datetime`` objects.

The input format is definded by a locale2pattern mapping and is provided by
a seperate interface.

Currently provided locales are:
  
- en
- de
- fr
- es
- uk
- it
- cs
- and the special locale ``iso``, which is used as default.


Example
-------

Use the convert function:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from bda.intellidatetime import convert
    >>> convert('1.1.08', locale='de')
    datetime.datetime(2008, 1, 1, 0, 0)


API
---

The signature of ``bda.intellidatetime.convert`` looks like so:

.. code-block:: python

    def convert(date, time=None, tzinfo=None, locale='iso'):
        """Convert the input to a datetime object.

        The convert function accepts unicode or non-unicode strings and tries
        to parse out Date and Time information as follows:
          * First try to get the localized datetime pattern information
          * If no one is found, a default pattern is used.
          * Parse the input by the definitions of the localized datetime pattern
          * Create a datetime object and return it

        The 'intelligence' is defined by following behaviour:

        Date:
          * If only one value is found f.e. '1', this value is handled as the
            day value, for month and for year the current ones are used.
          * Respective, if two values are given, they are handled as day and
            month, year is auto completed with the current year.
          * 3 values are a complete date information, if year is a 2-character
            string, it is handled as year in the current century
          * as limiters are all non-numeric values accepted
          * date input can be done without limiters, therefor all characters
            must be numbers, and the string length must be either 2, 4, 6 or 8
            characters. 2 characters define the day, 4 characters the day and
            the month, 6 characters day, month and the year of the current
            century and 8 characters define a complete date.

        Time:
          * If time is None, time is set to 00:00
          * if time is a 2-character string, it is handled as the hour, minutes
            are defined as 00
          * time input can be done without a limiter, therefor time must be an
            all numeric 4-character string, the first 2 chars are handled as
            hour, the second 2 chars as minute.
          * as limiter are all non-numeric values accepted
          * seconds are never computed and are therefor ALWAYS handled as '00'

        Limiters can be any 1 or more character non numeric values. An input
        can look like ``  %_2008 1 abcde 5 ---`` and is still valid and with
        default locale converted to ``datetime.datetime(2008, 1, 5, 0, 0)``.

        If parsing of the input values is not possible or converting the parsed
        values to numeric values is not possible or the valid date and time
        range falls out of scope, a ``DateTimeConversionError`` is raised.

        @param date - a date as string
        @param time - a time as string
        @param tzinfo - a tzinfo object to be considered, defaults to None. If
                        given the date and time taken as in the given timezone.
                        If the timezone is DST-aware time will be normalized
                        for DST/non-DST.
        @param locale - a locale name, which is used to determine the date and
                        time patterns. There exists a special locale named
                        'iso', which is default and expects the input in ISO
                        format.
        @return datetime - datetime.datetime object
        @raise DateTimeConversionError - if conversion fails
        """
